# SCREEN

Code for the paper titled "SCREEN: Stream Data Cleaning under Speed Constraints." released in SIGMOD 2015. This paper has been implemented by Nikhita Chamarti(nc20ce), Divya Lakshmi Varampati (dv22i), and Harshitha Kamineni (hk22j) 

We have 3 diffrent Algorithms that have been implemeted throughout this paper those are:

  Algorithm 1 (local optimum)
  
  Algorithm 2 (update local optimum)
  
  Algorithm 3 (heuristic)
